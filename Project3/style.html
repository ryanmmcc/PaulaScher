            <div class="prgph4">
            <p>Scher loved experimenting with drawing, painting and printmaking, but feels that she didn't find her own style until she did a course called Graphic Design in her junior year. In this course Paula did a lot of problem solving projects and created lots of abstract pieces using different symbols and shapes. During her time as Art Director at CBS Scher learned how to work in every style and became fascinated by period typography.</p>
            <br>
            <p>One of Paulas greatest achievements was being the first designer to create a new identity and different promotional graphics for The Public Theater in 1994.</p>
